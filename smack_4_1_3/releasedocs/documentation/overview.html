<h1>Smack Overview</h1><p><a href="index.html">Back</a></p><p>Smack is a library for communicating with XMPP servers to perform real-time communications, including instant messaging and group chat.</p><h2>Smack Key Advantages</h2>
<ul>
  <li><p>Extremely simple to use, yet powerful API. Sending a text message to a user can be accomplished in only a few lines of code:</p><p>```java AbstractXMPPConnection connection = new XMPPTCPConnection("mtucker", "password", "jabber.org"); connection.connect().login();</p><p>Chat chat = ChatManager.getInstanceFor(connection)  .createChat("jsmith@jivesoftware.com", new MessageListener() {</p>
  <pre><code>public void processMessage(Chat chat, Message message) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Received message: &quot; + message);
}
</code></pre>}); chat.sendMessage("Howdy!"); ```</li>
  <li><p>Doesn't force you to code at the packet level, as other libraries do. Smack provides intelligent higher level constructs such as the <code>Chat</code> and <code>Roster</code> classes, which let you program more efficiently. </p></li>
  <li>Does not require that you're familiar with the XMPP XML format, or even that you're familiar with XML.</li>
  <li>Provides easy machine to machine communication. Smack lets you set any number of properties on each message, including properties that are Java objects.</li>
  <li>Open Source under the Apache License, which means you can incorporate Smack into your commercial or non-commercial applications.</li>
</ul><h2>About XMPP</h2><p>XMPP (eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open protocol standardized by the IETF and supported and extended by the XMPP Standards Foundation ((<a href="http://www.xmpp.org">http://www.xmpp.org</a>).</p><h2>How To Use This Documentation</h2><p>This documentation assumes that you're already familiar with the main features of XMPP instant messaging. It's also highly recommended that you open the Javadoc API guide and use that as a reference while reading through this documentation.</p><p>Copyright (C) Jive Software 2002-2008</p>
